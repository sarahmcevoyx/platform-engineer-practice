# This is a CODEOWNERS file, but everything is commented out.

# Each line follows the pattern:
# <file pattern> <owner(s)>

# Example:
# * @your-team
# /docs/ @documentation-team
# /src/ @dev-team

# Uncomment the relevant lines when you want to enable ownership rules.
# Any sensitive files should be reviewed by individuals with higher access permissions, such as a Jenkinsfile
